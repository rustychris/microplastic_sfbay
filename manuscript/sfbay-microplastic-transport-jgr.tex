\section*{Plain Language Summary}
Microplastic pollution consists of plastic particles less than 5 mm in
diameter. Concentrations of these particles were measured in
wastewater and stormwater flows entering San Francisco Bay. A computer
model simulated how these particles are transported by the tides and
ocean currents, and predicted concentrations of microplastics
throughout the Bay and the coastal ocean. Comparison of the model predictions
with observed concentrations show that the model can explain a substantial
amount of the observed patterns. The model also shows that almost all
sinking particles are retained inside the Bay, while some floating particles
are carried into the coastal ocean and potentially reach nearby
National Marine Sanctuaries.

\section{Introduction}
  Microplastic pollution is a growing concern in surface waters, both
  inland and marine, yet the pathways between terrestrial sources and
  accumulation in open water and sediment is poorly quantified.

  Transport of microparticles and microplastics in surface waters is
  an essential component of understanding the fate of particles in the
  environment, and the degree to which microparticles entering surface
  water systems may be transported downstream and into the open
  ocean. Microplastic transport modeling in the open ocean has
  demonstrated the physical processes responsible for mid-ocean
  accumulation zones, specifically looking at surface-bound, buoyant
  particles (e.g., Lebreton et al, 2019).
  % Need a better reference here. Jambeck is about total loads, but
  % I think she stops shy of a budget
  Loading studies such as {\bf
  Jambeck et al} find that the microplastic budgets including
  estimated loads and open ocean concentrations do not close, and
  suggest large loss terms somewhere between the point of loading and
  the open ocean.

  Sutton et al.(2016) found that particles entering San Francisco Bay
  exhibited a wide variety of characteristics and likely have a wide
  range of settling velocities.  Studies of sediment transport
  dynamics suggest that transport and fate of material in an estuarine
  setting is highly dependent on settling velocities (Williams et al,
  2004), and only a fully three-dimensional analysis of transport can
  capture the breadth of relevant mechanisms (Scheu et al, 2015).
  
  This study links microplastic loads in stormwater and wastewater to
  ambient concentrations in San Francisco Bay and the coastal ocean by
  means of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and particle tracking
  model.  Microscopy and spectoscopy data for collected particles are
  used to estimate particle settling rates. Particle tracking results
  bear out the major patterns in the observed concentrations, and
  suggests a surface persistnce time scale on the order of days,
  before particles are degraded or fouled and sink from the water
  surface. Abundance within the Bay is shown to be substantially
  higher than in the coastal ocean.  Particle buoyancy exerts a strong
  control on the fate of particles, with negatively buoyant particles
  effectively trapped within the Bay due to interactions with
  estuarine circulation.

\subsection{San Francisco Bay}

The study area is San Francisco Bay and the adjacent coastal ocean
including the majority of three National Marine Sanctuaries (Greater
Farallones, Cordell Bank and Monterey Bay).

% Physical setting
San Francisco Bay is a mesotidal estuary with mixed diurnal and
semidiurnal tides, and a great diurnal range of 1.78 m. The Bay is
composed of two distinct reaches, broadly South Bay and North Bay. The
southern reach (South Bay) is lagoon-like, with minimal river inflows,
broad shoals, and a single channel \cite{Conomos1985}.  The northern
reach (collectively North Bay) includes two distinct embayments, the
more seaward San Pablo Bay and the landward Suisun Bay, situated
downstream of the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
Rivers. The interaction of the tides and river flows (from the
Sacramento, San Joaquin and Napa Rivers) maintain North
Bay as a partially mixed estuary. The Mediterranean climate has a
distinct wet season, October through April, countered by dry
conditions in the remainder of the year.
Dry season freshwater flows into South Bay are primarily from treated wastewater
discharges, with wet season runoff entering the Bay through
numerous small tributaries.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Field Observations}

Microparticle concentrations were measured in stormwater, wastewater,
ambient surface water, and sediment grab samples.

\subsubsection{Wastewater}

Samples were collected from eight of the forty-two wastewater
treatment facilities that discharge into San Francisco Bay. The chosen
facilities represent 70\% of the wastewater discharge into the Bay,
and are geographically distributed throughout the Bay.
The facilities vary in treatment capacity from 90 to 630 million liters per day,
and include secondary treatment processes and in some cases tertiary
treatment.

Effluent from the facilities was collected in the summer (dry season)
and fall (wet season) of 2017. Samples were collected during the week
(Tuesday--Friday) to avoid potential biases due to week/weekend
variation.  In each case, effluent was run through a flow meter and
particles were collected in a sieve stack (355 $\mu\textrm{m}$ and 125 $\mu\textrm{m}$
stainless steel mesh). The sieves were covered during sampling to
minimize deposition of airborne particles. See
\citeA{SFEImoore_project} for a full description of the sampling
methodology.  A field blank was collected at one facility by setting
out a duplicate sieve stack for the duration of the sampling.
After sampling, sieves were sealed in foil for transport to a
local laboratory where particles were rinsed off of the sieves into glass
jars with distilled water.

Jars were shipped to the University of Toronto for further analysis.
There the samples were dewatered, digested in 20\% KOH for one week,
rinsed with reverse-osmosis-treated water, and prepared for visual
microscopy.
