In some manta samples fibers were not counted at all.

One of the sediment blanks was no good b/c it only included
the smallest sieve.

Manta only included 350um sieve, while other methods included 125um.
 - here, just say that the model includes smaller size classes while
   the manta data doesn't.
 
 
Becky suggests comparing the field blank and lab blank.  In other chapters,
they combined them.  I'm not so sure.

Compare sediment values to Diana's chapter.


The major to-dos:
 1. DONE Make sure that I'm looking at the right polymer column. Becky saw some plastic
    types that shouldn't have been in the most recent.  But that's probably because
    I was showing the old table of densities.  Done.
 2. Remake the density plots, distributions, etc., now accounting for both the new
    harmonization and the fractional weights.
        - DONE re-draw the pathway plot to account for updates in density.
        - DONE update the plastic type plot to account for only proper samples as in the
          pathway plot.
        - DONE update the numbers to reflect also valid field samples only (the numbers of
          total particles, and how many got a w_s).
        - DONE same update for the morphology plot.
        
 3. Reconsider blanks in stormwater and wastewater for the purposes of setting loads.
    Treat blank counts per morphology, and de-rate / weight each particle based on the
    respective blanks.
 4. Regenerate source densities, in a w/fiber and w/o fiber scenario.
 5. Run ptm postprocessing again.
 6. Adjust plots to show w/ and w/o fibers for manta, and to use blank-de-rated
    data in all cases.
